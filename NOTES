Code update is for handling Viscosity, instead of System Events-based VPN via OSX.

NOTES/TODO (I keep telling myself that at some point, I'll come back and add in OSX notifications, and other features...)

Need Cocoa-AppleScript Applet in order to send notifications from AppleScript to OSX Notifications Center: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=39189

If you want to remove applications from notifications, check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11993145/remove-application-from-notification-center
--tell application "System Events"
--	get properties
--end tell
